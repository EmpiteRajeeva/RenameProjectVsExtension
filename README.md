# Rename project name in:
  - project location folder
  - solution file
  - reference in other projects
  - assembly name, information
  - default namespace
 
Only tested for c# projects, but should work for any other projects (vb, c++ and etc).

It doesn't matter if project is located in solution folder (even for subfolder of solution folder) 

In case of error at any stage of renaming project, all changes will be rolled back.  

Please, feel free to write about any mistake and suggestion
