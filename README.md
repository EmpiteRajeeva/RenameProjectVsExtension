# Rename project name in:
  - project location folder
  - solution file
  - reference in other projects
  - assembly name, information
  - default namespace
 
Only tested for c# projects.

It doesn't matter if project is located in solution folder (even for subfolder of solution folder) 

In case of error at any stage of renaming project, all changes will be rolled back.
